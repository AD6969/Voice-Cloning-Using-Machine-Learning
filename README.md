# Voice Cloning Using Machine Learning

Voice cloning is a cutting-edge application of machine learning that enables the replication of a person’s voice with high fidelity. This project implements a voice cloning system using machine learning models to capture the unique characteristics of a speaker's voice and synthesize realistic speech.  

The goal is to create a system capable of generating speech that mimics the target speaker’s tone, pitch, and rhythm while maintaining intelligibility and naturalness.  

## Key Features  

- **Speaker Voice Synthesis**: Clone a person's voice based on a short audio sample.  
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Convert written text into speech using the cloned voice.  
- **High Accuracy**: Achieve natural voice reproduction by capturing subtle speaker characteristics.  
- **Customizable Cloning**: Train on specific datasets to create personalized voice profiles.  
- **Real-Time Voice Generation**: Provide fast synthesis for practical applications.  

## Components  

1. **Speaker Encoder**  
   - Extracts speaker embeddings from a short audio sample to capture unique vocal features.  
   - Trained on a large corpus of diverse speaker data.  

2. **Synthesizer**  
   - Converts text input into a mel spectrogram using the extracted speaker embeddings.  
   - Handles language nuances like intonation and emphasis.  

3. **Vocoder**  
   - Converts mel spectrograms into high-quality audio.  
   - Utilizes neural vocoder models like WaveNet or HiFi-GAN for natural sound production.  

## Applications  

- **Virtual Assistants**: Personalize assistants like Alexa or Siri with custom voices.  
- **Audiobook Narration**: Generate audiobooks in the voice of the author or a chosen narrator.  
- **Voice Restoration**: Assist individuals with voice impairments by recreating their original voice.  
- **Entertainment**: Create realistic voiceovers for games, films, and animations.  

## Workflow  

1. **Input Audio**: Provide a short audio sample of the target speaker.  
2. **Speaker Encoding**: Extract unique voice characteristics using the speaker encoder.  
3. **Text Input**: Provide text to be converted into speech.  
4. **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Generate a mel spectrogram based on the speaker embedding and input text.  
5. **Audio Generation**: Convert the spectrogram into audio using the vocoder.  

## Datasets  

The system can be trained using publicly available datasets such as:  
- [LibriSpeech](https://www.openslr.org/12): A corpus of read English speech.  
- [VCTK](https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/2651): A multi-speaker English speech dataset.  
- [Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/): A multilingual dataset for voice-related tasks.  

## Installation  

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Voice-Cloning.git  
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
3. Run the training scripts to set up the models (see the documentation for details).  

## Future Scope  

- **Multilingual Support**: Expand the system to handle multiple languages.  
- **Real-Time Cloning**: Enhance processing speed for live voice cloning.  
- **Emotion Synthesis**: Incorporate emotional tones into synthesized speech.  
- **Noise Robustness**: Improve performance in noisy environments.
